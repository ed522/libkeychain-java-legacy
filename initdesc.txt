# Description of init process

## 1. Greeting

The initialization process starts with a greeting. This is
a small negotiation to agree on the following:

1. The status of the connection (success status, errno)
2. The status of trust
3. The latest server certificate
4. The status of the client's certificate (validity and enrolment)
5. The client's certificate
6. The client's alias
7. Supported extensions
8. Random cookies (replay prevention)

The greeting is able to be executed with just 3 messages
(server -> client -> server -> client). This can be
accomplished by using the following process:

1. ServerGreeting:
    - Trust
    - Latest cert date
    - Extension list
    - Random cookies
2. ClientGreeting:
    - Alias
    - Certificate
    - Supported extensions
    - Client's latest cert date
    - Verification (including random cookies)
3. ServerResponse:
    - Status
    - New certificate, with a seperate signature corresponding to the old one
    - Enrolment status
